Sometimes, when I use images, I have problems with its rotation even if in the thumbnail all seems good.
This script allows you to rotate a list of images contained in a folder, which has to contain only images,
to fix this problem. You can rotate the photos however you wanted, by running this script from terminal in this way:
    python main.py --folder /path/to/images/folder --degree /degree/of/rotation
